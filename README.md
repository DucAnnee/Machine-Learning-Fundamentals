## The journey begins
Actually, my journey of diving into the Machine Learning field started several years ago with some basic Computer Vision and Deep learning projects. However, over the years, I realize I can't recall any i learn, probably because I don't actually "learn" anything, just keep going round and round in the tutorial hell. Therefore, I decided to learn **everything** from scratch and try every way to grasp the smallest fundamental in this field, hoping for an internship next year.
